Operand Stack
..., objectref →

...

Description
The <n> must be an index into the local variable array of the current frame (§2.6). The objectref on the top of the operand stack must be of type returnAddress or of type reference. It is popped from the operand stack, and the value of the local variable at <n> is set to objectref.

Notes
An astore_<n> instruction is used with an objectref of type returnAddress when implementing the finally clauses of the Java programming language (§3.13).

An aload_<n> instruction (§aload_<n>) cannot be used to load a value of type returnAddress from a local variable onto the operand stack. This asymmetry with the corresponding astore_<n> instruction is intentional.

Each of the astore_<n> instructions is the same as astore with an index of <n>, except that the operand <n> is implicit.
